            <div class="card vertical-card">

                <strong>Our Humble Beginning</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>A group of visionary minds came together with a shared dream to cultivate not just crops but a
                        future enriched by sustainable agriculture.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>This dream took root and blossomed into Agrinet, a platform that transcends the fields to
                        empower
                        farmers and enthusiasts alike.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Our founders, a blend of tech enthusiasts and seasoned agriculturists, recognized the challenges
                        faced by farmers in navigating the complexities of modern agriculture.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>The desire to bridge the gap between traditional wisdom and cutting-edge technology ignited the
                        spark that would become Agrinet.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
